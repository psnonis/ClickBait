Team 14
Brian Musisi, Pri Nonis, Vinicio Del Sola, Laura Chutny
Fall 2019, Section 3

## Progress Report Nov 27, 2019

## Laura
- To date: Project planning, started final write up, numerical feature analysis and standardization, literature review, group coordination
- To come: toy model for chosen algorithm(s), with documentation and write up, work on categorical variable feature engineering. Testing parallel algorithm and continued project communication and coordination. Final report preparation.

## Vinicio
- To date: Started the Toy homegrown model - SVM with L2, with all the math explanation. Started the gradient descent code for the toy model using an RDD implementation. Review literature in cathegorical variables (bin, hashed features, hot-encode). Participated in the discussions of EDA preparatations.
- To come: Finish the SVM model and add L1 regularization and, if time permits, the kernel trick for capturing non-linearities. Help to implement Baseline Production model (Logistic Regression) and Vector model as comparison.
